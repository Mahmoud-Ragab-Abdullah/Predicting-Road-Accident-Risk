# Predicting-Road-Accident-Risk

Project Overview
This project focuses on building a highly accurate machine learning model to predict the continuous probability of a road accident for specific road segments. By analyzing key environmental and structural factors, the model provides a critical risk assessment score (a probability between 0 and 1) crucial for urban planning, resource allocation, and targeted safety interventions.
